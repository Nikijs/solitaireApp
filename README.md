Order the cards accoring to their color and ranking
Instructions on how to play the game
and information about the game can be found here: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/solitaire/
My inspiration was the google solitaire game on easy mode, instead of dealing 3 cards, deals 1 at a time
Made using Visual Studio 2017 (Tested using UWP simulator, not tested on a device due to lack of resources)
VS V15.9.9 .NET V4.8.03752
